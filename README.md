## Audio Content Guidelines

### ‚úÖ What's Allowed
- Pure human voice humming without meaningful words
- Nonsense syllables like "la la la", "ta ka to ko", "wo wo wo"
- Original humming compositions
- Slightly modified covers or tribute-style humming (the ones which apparently contain feel of respect to originators)

## Technical Requirements

### Recommended Browsers
- **Windows/Linux/Android**: Google Chrome
- **macOS/iPadOS/iOS**: Safari
- **Note**: Firefox over all OS types tends to cause click noise during recording (No idea why this happens...)
- **Android Firefox**: Drag & drop doesn't work - avoid!

### Recording Tips
- Use Google Chrome for best recording experience (I am not from Google tho...)
- On Apple devices, use Safari only (actually I did not test yet with any Apple devices, plz check someone...)
- If click noise detected via your device, wait 1-2 seconds after pressing record button before humming (reduces noise)
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted

### Account Security

## Community Guidelines

### Fair Use
- One App account per person recommended (linking OAuth accounts to one App account is permitted)

## Essential Weaknesses of This App
- You can play clips from the normal playback bar, so the "HUM 'em ALL mode" feature isn't really necessary
- Due to the app's design, the users record clips at their own discretion. This makes it impossible to align the audio start points of each clip, preventing the creation of a typical "song". Therefore, its appeal lies in enjoying it as a loop station usage or embracing the random variations and fluctuations between hummed clips, positioning it as an experimental style

## App Philosophy

"HUM 'em ALL is designed for spontaneous, joyful humming - not serious music production. Hum when you feel like it, don't force it! (Do not fight, but feel method). The goal is to create a playful community where individual humming contributions can magically combine into something unexpectedly delightful. (so that we are able to navigate the VUCA era ahead)"

- To those in the midst of battle or facing wartime conditions, may you find a peaceful haven where you can, at last, hum a song without a care in the world.
- It is my sincere hope that more people around the world will start humming without even realizing it.(spontaneously is the key factor)

### Remember
- üéµ Humming is the result, not the goal (Do not try to control)
- üé≠ Keep it fun and experimental (rather than popular standpoint)
- üåç Respect the global community (escaping from "Living only for today, money, and themselves" practices)
- ‚è∞ Enjoy the ~1 year or so journey (app has been set limited runtime intentionally, in anticipation of admin's burnout syndrome)
